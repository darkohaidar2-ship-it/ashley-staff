name: qwencloud-deploy
version: "2.2"
description: >-
  One-click deploy, publish, and update a local project or Git repository to Alibaba Cloud
  International (alibabacloud.com), producing an accessible online service with a public IP.
  Supports full-stack ROS orchestration, automatic cloud-resource provisioning, pre-deployment
  price confirmation, service health checks, deployment-state recording, hot updates, and
  optional domain + HTTPS setup.
  Use when: the user asks to deploy a project to the cloud, put an app online, publish a
  website, generate an access URL, deploy a Git repo, or update an online version and has NOT
  named a specific cloud platform; or the user mentions "Alibaba Cloud", "alibabacloud.com",
  or the international site.
  Do not use when: the user explicitly targets Aliyun China (aliyun.com), AWS, GCP, Azure, or
  another specific cloud platform.

  Use when the user asks to deploy a project to the cloud, put an app online, publish a website,

  a particular cloud platform. Also use when the user mentions "Alibaba Cloud", "alibabacloud.com",
  or the international site.

prerequisites:
  - aliyun CLI 3.x configured with international-site credentials in OAuth mode
input: >-
  A local project directory, Git URL, or an existing deployment state file (.qwencloud-deploy).
  Optional: user preferences for instance type, region, database.
output: >-
  A running cloud service with public IP (or domain + HTTPS), deployment state file
  (.qwencloud-deploy), and success card with access URL, cost summary, and next-step guidance.

# Qwen Cloud Deploy

## Quick Path

1. **Route the task** — Match to one of 4 modes: Full-Stack Deploy · Hot Update · Delete · HTTPS Setup.
2. **Deploy (default)** — Execute steps 1→13 in order; each step has a reference doc.
3. **Confirm cost before creating anything** — Show hourly price in USD, get user confirmation.
4. **Record state** — On success write `.qwencloud-deploy`.

## Scope

| In Scope | Out of Scope |
|----------|--------------|
| Local project / Git → Alibaba Cloud International | China site → use `qianwenai-deploy` |
| Full-stack ROS, hot update, cleanup | AWS/GCP/Azure/other clouds |
| ECS + optional RDS + OSS + public IP | K8s/Serverless/container orchestration |
| OAuth/AK auth (no credential collection) | — |

## Assumptions

- `aliyun` CLI 3.x installed; when no valid credential, follow `reference/deploy/01_env_check.md`.
- Default region `ap-southeast-1` (Singapore).

---

## Task Routing

| Signal | Mode |
|--------|------|
| `.qwencloud-deploy` exists + user says "update" | **Hot Update** |
| `.qwencloud-deploy` exists + "delete"/"cleanup" | **Delete** |
| "bind domain"/"HTTPS"/"SSL" (deployment exists) | **HTTPS Setup** |
| Git URL or local project (no existing deployment) | **Full-Stack Deploy** |

On trigger, display welcome message first (see `reference/rules/rule_interaction.md`).

---

## Full-Stack Deploy (Steps 1–13)

### Phase 1 · Preparation

| Step | Action | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Environment check | `reference/deploy/01_env_check.md` |
| 2 | Git clone (if Git URL) | `reference/deploy/02_git_clone.md` |
| 3 | Project analysis | `reference/deploy/03_analyze_project.md` |

### Phase 2 · Resource Planning

| Step | Action | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 4 | Existing deployment scan | `reference/deploy/04_check_existing.md` |
| 5 | Database identification | `reference/deploy/05_database.md` |
| 6 | ECS instance type selection | `reference/deploy/06_instance_type.md` |
| 7 | Generate ROS template | `reference/deploy/07_generate_template.md` |
| 8 | Stock check | `reference/deploy/08_check_stock.md` |
| 9 | Template validation + cost estimate | `reference/deploy/09_estimate_cost.md` |

### Phase 3 · Execution

| Step | Action | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| 10 | Upload artifacts + regenerate template | `reference/deploy/10_upload_artifacts.md` |
| 11 | Create stack | `reference/deploy/11_create_stack.md` |
| 12 | Wait for terminal state + health check | `reference/deploy/12_wait_stack.md` |
| 13 | Record state | `reference/deploy/13_record_state.md` |

---

## Hot Update

**Trigger**: `.qwencloud-deploy` exists + user wants to update code. IP unchanged.

| Step | Action | Reference |
|------|--------|-----------|
| U1 | Build + upload new artifacts | `reference/deploy/10_upload_artifacts.md` |
| U2 | Deliver update (Cloud Assistant) | `reference/hotfix/update_app.md` |
| U3 | Health check + update state | `reference/hotfix/update_app.md` |

Update script template: `reference/hotfix/update_recipe.md`.

---

## Delete / Cleanup

**Trigger**: User says "delete", "cleanup", "release resources".

> ⚠️ Irreversible — confirm twice. With RDS: warn about data loss.

> 🚫 Never manually delete individual resources — only use `delete_stack.sh`.

See `reference/cleanup/delete_stack.md`.

---

## HTTPS Setup (Optional)

**Trigger**: User says "bind domain" / "HTTPS" / "SSL" after deployment exists.

See `reference/https/https_setup.md`.

---

## Key Constraints

| Constraint | Rule |
|------------|------|
| Currency | Always USD |
| Auth | OAuth (recommended) or AK/SK; never collect credentials via chat |
| Template upload | Must use `--TemplateURL` (WAF blocks TemplateBody) |
| Stack name retry | Reuse — never regenerate |
| Resource deletion | Always via `delete_stack.sh` |
| Region default | `ap-southeast-1` |
| Commands to user | Never show underlying commands |
